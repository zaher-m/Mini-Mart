Project Title: "MiniMart" â€“ Client-Side E-Commerce Site

Functional Requirements

1. Product Listing Page

- Implement category filtering (e.g., electronics, clothing, etc.).
- Include a search bar to filter products by name.

2. Favorites Page

- Store favorites in localStorage.
- Display all favorite items on a separate page.
- Allow users to remove items from favorites.

3. Cart Page
- Enable users to add products to a cart.
- Show cart items with quantity, subtotal, and total price.
- Allow users to update quantity or remove items.

4. Checkout Page

Technical Requirements

Bonus Challenges (Optional)
- Add a loading spinner while fetching data.
- Implement pagination or lazy loading.
- Add price range filtering.
